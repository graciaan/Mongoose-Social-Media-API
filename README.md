# Mongoose-Social-Media-API

Welcome to the Mongoose Social Media API!

This is back-end code that is meant to allow users to create users, post thoughts, and add reactions. All of these can also be updated or deleted.

This is just the back-end so a front-end would need to be developed to allow full functionality. For now, this can be installed using the command "npm install" and can be tested with Insomnia.
